once again, lmk if you want anything done for you cuz i got you covered.
# my roblox career
you may think roblox is just a shitty kids game, but theres a lot to it. roblox was the origin of my coding journey and i wouldnt be here without it, thank you so much david baszucki for making my childhood 100% better and opening new doors to tons of cool shit!!

### **2018** (the start if my coding career lmao)
#### Sword Fight Royale - my first ever game!! 
i had joined roblox 2 year back in 2016 just to play games and soon make new friends and meet new people but in 2018 i got really interested in how the games were made. surprisingly, i learned lua coding through the heavily outdated roblox university series and put what i learned together to make a little really hacking vulnerable sword fight battle royale game where you earn points for winning. pretty basic. there was actually an ambitious idea  had where you could buy stuff with the points you earned but that never got around to happening, mightve been too hard for me.
#### Snowball Fight - to be remastered this year.
it was mainly just free premade models and tutorials put around. i thought coding was really hard at first but later i got through it. it was a never ending snowball fight game you could play with friends. still nothing much around it.
### **2019** (the better year, idk what to call it lmao)
that year i learned a bit of javascript (i was forced to) from school in khan academy. the little engine they had in there was super basic but in the end it was super fun to see what others made and what i could make. javascript never had that much influence on me, so i went back to roblox stuff.
#### Fall Into The Target - self explanatory LOL
fall into the target was a little game that was wayy more basic and rushed than anything i had ever made. you spawned ontop of a little platform and jumped off into a target. depending in how well you fell into it, you would get points. a pretty grindy game tbh, the idea could be expanded today to move onto an actual fun game.
> note, not much was actually made in 2019 idk why it was just motivation, but i assure you 2020 and 2021 are gonna be wayy better trust me
### **2020** (starting to go up omg omg)
#### Sword Fight Royale Remaster - woahh back to basics!!
like i said, back to basic. i was out of ideas so i remade my first actual game in about a week with cosmetics, things to buy, and more. i played it with only a couple of my friends but after that motivation was pretty much lost cuz it just got too crazy. almost 20 scripts were in the game alone, so it was getting really laggy.
#### Ice Fight - snowball fight remaster (went through december 2020 to feburary 2021)
with my friend back in december, he made a cool model and map for a snowball game. i spend about a week perfecting a little physics engine for roblox that calculated angles and how far something could go, to where we got a skill based snowball engine. it was really fun but a couple all nighters were spent working on it, definetly the most motivated ive ever been for a game.
### **2021** (a new dawn)
#### Continuing Ice Fight - wow!!
we had made the game loop, reload stations, kill counters, everything. the game is kinda flopped but i'm still really proud of it!! the game is finished!!
#### She Hears - current project
she hears is a work in progress 3 player horror game where the key is to communicate with as little interaction. every time you communicate, she gets closer, and when she gets closer, she bites. its a slightly scripted puzzle game where you have to communicate and solve puzzles with each others help. in basic sense, say one person has all the codes for a bunch of code doors everyone has, that person has to tell the others the codes with as little messages as possible or they will die. we have a dynamic system where puzzles drop out and mix and match for harder ones when people die, and the last person standing who can make it out alive wins the game.

## thats all ive ever worked on for roblox!
